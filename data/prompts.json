[{"prompt": "Can you tell me about taking a risk and failing? ", "response": "Situation or Problem: In 2015 ABC Television wanted an MTA model in addition to the MMM model that we had built them. Our director left and I took the lead on the project and assumed the data integration work was QA\u2019ed correctly but it had not been. It was 4 months later that I realized that the data we (marketing & TV viewership) could not be joined.  Actions I Took: I informed senior leadership of the oversight and took full responsibility, provided them a plan to develop a model similar to the one they wanted along with a timeline and sample output they would get. I did the data integration Q & A that should have happened but never did prior to me taking on the project.  Outcome: The model wound up being created and results delivered but the delays to the project meant that decisions could not be made during the TV Upfronts that year. I learned a valuable lesson in that project and that was that when taking on a project one must dig deep to understand what happened before, revisit key assumptions, and ensure the foundational strategy & data for the project are valid before jumping in. The final outcome was a profitable share shift in marketing budgets resulting in reduced cost per acquisition of 22% by focusing more on video ads, per the models recommendations. "}, {"prompt": "Can you explain to me how you lead a project? ", "response": "Situation or Problem:  While at 20th Century Fox we were tasked with building an AI/ML based recommendation system to support our marketing strategy on YouTube for new movie releases. As a new Director of Data Science I was put in charge of creating a preliminary model,  hiring the 5 data scientists, developing the Cloud based systems that would support the tools. Then Disney announced they would be buying 20th Century Fox for $71 billion. We knew that our jobs were on the line and that we had to do amazing work.  Actions I Took: Hired 3 data scientists and helped conduct the technical interviews including SQL and TensorFlow Lobbied our SVP to send us to Cloud Based AI/ML training at Google to get the team trained quickly Developed the ML data pipeline that processed huge amounts of movie trailer, movie script, and consumer data for 200+ movies and millions of customer records Collaborated with scientists to guild the building of a deep learning model Outcome: Our work was featured on Google Blog post for how ML/AI can be done at a movie studio I was featured on a podcast to discuss the top as well as at UCLA Anderson\u2019s School of Management Media & Entertainment panel The system wound up helping drive the success of the movies Bohemian Rhapsody, The Greatest Showman, and a host of other studios. We estimated that the project brought in and additional $50 million in revenue to the movie studio at a critical time. "}, {"prompt": "How have you used data to develop a strategy?", "response": "Situation or Problem: At Disney the traditional way that TV shows would get selected was in a process called \u201cGreenlighting\u201d where directors/writers would pitch their ideas for shows to senior executives. These are high stakes decisions because failing to produce a hit show like Friends, The Mandolorian, or Game of Thrones can cost an entertainment billions in the long-run. On the flip side, producing shows that don\u2019t have a positive ROI is inefficient, and costly in terms of production. My team was tasked with finding a way to quantify the potential of a TV show just based on the initial script.  Actions I Took:  Collected the scripts from decades of television shows Collected their initial Nielsen ratings for the shows premiere and adjusted for the natural decline in TV ratings Collected average marketing spend for each TV show and adjusted it for inflation Created an AI/ML model that processed the text and predicted the likelihood that the show would have appeal based on the content of the show The model had one of three outputs: potential hit, potential dud, and unsure. The model was 80+% accurate in predicting shows that could be potential hits.  Outcome:  The models were introduced into the green lighting process at the studio, a revolutionary move to influence a decades old process using data The model found that shows representing people of AA heritage would do well, and that in turn prompted the green lighting of popular ABC shows from Shonda Rhimes like How to Get Away with Murder, Black-ish, etc. "}]
